# first-hole
Just Testing the ground water..
(1) Created repo - with this readme
(2) Created branch readme-edits to poke further into this hole
(3) Added some shiney new words to this readme ( Make and Commit Changes bit )

Next.. To add a commit massage to describe what I've done.. then poke around to find and click the commit thing..

 (4) Now changing again locally to add line for issue01 - But now added some words in GITHub editor :)
 (5) Thought I'd finished but another entry here, now - going to raise a pull request.
